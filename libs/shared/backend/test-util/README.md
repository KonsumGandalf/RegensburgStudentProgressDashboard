# shared-backend-test-util

This library provides a "RepositoryMock" class for simulating the behavior of a
TypeORM repository in tests. The "RepositoryMock" class can be used as a substitute
for the actual repository in tests, allowing for isolated and predictable testing
of the application's database interactions. The library is designed to ensure reusability,
maintainability, and thorough documentation.
