# shared-backend-utils

This commit adds a RepositoryMock class to the project for simulating the behavior of a TypeORM repository in tests.
The RepositoryMock class can be used as a substitute for the actual repository in tests, allowing for isolated and
predictable testing of the application's database interactions.
