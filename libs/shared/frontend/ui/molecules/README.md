# shared-frontend-ui-molecules

The shared-frontend-ui-molecules library is a collection of reusable UI components that represent intermediate-level
building blocks in the user interface. These components are more complex than atomic components, but still encapsulate a
specific UI functionality or feature. They are designed to be combined with other atomic components and molecules to
create more sophisticated UI elements.
