# user-backend-user-authentication

This backend API provides user authentication functionality. Users can register and log in to access restricted parts of
the application. The API also includes email confirmation, where users receive a confirmation link with a JWT token upon
registration. The confirmation page verifies the token and marks the user's email as confirmed.
